### Barber Shop simulation

#### Running the program
To execute the program simply clone this repo and run the command `$ ./gradlew run` in your terminal on Mac/Unix or `$ gradlew.bat run` on Windows. You'll need JDK installed to be able to run this gradle command which will pull all the dependencies
and build the project before running. An easy way to install a jdk is `$ brew install openjdk`.

Alternatively you can directly run the [packaged jar](https://github.com/mir-uddin/JobyShopSim/releases/tag/v1-simulation) using `$ java -jar barbershopsim.jar`. (Still requires a java runtime on your machine. You can confirm if you already have it by running `$ java -version`.)

_Please let me know if you run into any difficulties building and running the project._
